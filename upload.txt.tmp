This is for maintenance for GDP-12.  

The branch for 12.x is made for the maintenance as it is requested.
However, it is branched from 2 commits behind ( cfafb73... ).
so the pull request includes missing 2 commits + my commit for fixing build.

https://at.projects.genivi.org/jira/browse/GDP-774

This meta is submodule of genivi-dev-platform, and 
I will also make pull request to track the newest source.
